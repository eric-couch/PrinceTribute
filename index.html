        Mourning has no sense of priorities. When an artist's achievement is as
        complex as Prince's was, trying to assess his huge legacy is undone by
        recognition that now everything is in the past tense: that panoply of
        scorching and/or aching grooves, the Jimi Hendrix-meets-Keith Richards
        guitar fused with a voice able to switch from angelic to devilish
        quicker than Charlie Chaplin wiggling his mustache, the pansexual Pied
        Piperism and belief that all life is a doomed but exciting revolt
        against death, the effrontery and wit of the whole Â­project even after
        he had been at it for decades. But every appreciation has to start
        somewhere.
